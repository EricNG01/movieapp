# Movie Review Application

## Developed using
A full-stack movie review application that allows users to search and explore movie details, reviews, and trailers. This project demonstrates proficiency in integrating third-party APIs, containerisation, and cloud deployment.

### Tech Stack:
- **React.js**: Front-end developed using React.js to provide a dynamic, responsive user experience.
- **Express.js**: Back-end API server built with Express.js for handling requests and routing.
- **Docker**: Containerised the application for consistent development, testing, and production environments.
- **Amazon AWS**: Deployed the Dockerised application to the Amazon AWS platform for scalability and global accessibility.

### Features:
- **RESTful API Integration**: Integrated APIs from OMDb, YouTube, and The New York Times to display comprehensive movie-related data, including reviews and trailers.
- **Real-time Visitor Tracker**: Implemented cloud-based persistence services using Amazon S3 and Redis to track visitor activity in real-time.
- **Movie Search Functionality**: Robust search functionality that dynamically displays movie information based on user queries.

This project showcases my ability to build, containerize, and deploy full-stack applications with cloud services and API integrations.
